<h1>Project Design </h1>
<p>
This page is dedicated to laying out the secondary design of the project.
This is not intended to be a final design but an initial idea on how the game will be laid out and played.


<h3><u>Constants:</u> (in JavaScript these are just unchanging variables)</h3>

<strong>BEGINNER_SIZE:</strong>  The size of the grid for a beginner game. This will be set from the selected player level<br>
<strong>INTERMEDIATE_SIZE:</strong>  The size of the grid for an intermediate game. This will be set from the selected player level<br>
<strong>ADVANCED_SIZE:</strong> The size of an advanced game. This will be set from the selected player level<br>
<strong>BEGINNER_BOMB_COUNT:</strong> The maximum number of bombs for a beginner game.<br>
<strong>INTERMEDIATE_BOMB_COUNT:</strong> The maximum number of bombs for a intermediate game.<br>
<strong>ADVANCED_BOMB_COUNT:</strong> The maximum number of bombs for a advanced game.<br>

<h3><u>Objects:</u></h3>

<strong>2Dimentioal Array</strong> 
<br>A square will have a <strong>_bomb,</strong>  <strong>_adjacentBombs</strong>  and a <strong>_flaged</strong> property.<br>

<ul>
<li> <strong>_bomb</strong>: boolean property to determine if it holds a or not.  </li>
<li> <strong>_adjacentBombs</strong>: if there is not a bomb  it will hold the number of adjacent bombs</li>
<li> <strong>_flagged</strong>: tells if the sqare has been marked by a flag </li>
</ul>

<br> 2D Array object example: <br>
_gameArray[i][j] = "true" (is a bomb);<br />
_gameArray[i][j] = "adjacent" (is the adjacent bomb count);<br />
_gameArray[i][j] = "flag" (this will hold a flag)<br />
<br>
<hr>
<strong>Bomb</strong>
<br> A Game will have a _bombCount property. <br>

<ul>
<li> <strong> _bombCount </strong>: This will count the number of bombs flagged. <br>

</ul>

<br> Game object example: <br>
{"_bombCount" :  20} <br>

<br>
<hr>
<strong>Clock</strong>
<br> A Game will have a _timeCount property. <br>

<ul>
    <li> <strong> _timeCount </strong>: This will count the time that a player uses to solve the puzzle. <br>

</ul>

<br> Game object example: <br>
{"_timeCount" :  20} <br>

<br>
<hr>
<strong>Difficulty</strong>
The Difficulty object will have <strong> _beginner, _intermdiate_,</strong> and <strong>_advanced </strong> properties.

<ul>
<li><strong>_beginner</strong>: a integer value that will be used when calling the difficulty function
when the game is being set up.</li>
<li><strong>_intermdiate_</strong>: a integer value that will be used when calling the difficulty function
when the game is being set up.</li>
<li><strong>_advanced</strong>: a integer value that will be used when calling the difficulty function
when the game is being set up.</li>
</ul>


<br>

<h3><u>Functions / Model:</u></h3>

The model for this game will use the functions listed below:  Upon the page loading a beginner game will be set up.  
If the user chooses a different game level, then the page will update to that level, using the setLevel Function.
The gameController function will be called, which sets the bombs and adjacent square numbers. 
The time function will start, and the game is ready for the user to play.

As the user sets flags, the bomb count will go down and the square will be replaced with a flag, and will only be able to have a flag removed
this will all be done with the setFlags function.

When the flags match the bombs as called by the winner function, the game will end. 

<I>setLevel(_BEGINNER_SIZE)</I>: This will be used to deterimine the size of the grid.
<br>
    <br />
<i>gameController(_gridSize)</i>: This will be used to set the bombs, and determine the number to be placed in the 
   adjacent squares.
    <br />
<br />
<I>setFlags(_gameArray)</I>: This will be called when a player right clicks and places a flag or removes a flag.
 <br />
    <br />
<I>clockCount()</I>: this function will be a counter that tells how much time it has taken to complete the game.
<br>
    <br />
<I>bombCount(_flagCount)</I>: this function will show how many bombs have not been flagged.
<br><br>

<I>createGrid(_gridSize, _gameArray)</I>: this function will produce the HTML for the game.

<br /><br />
<i>winner()</i>: the winner function will be called when the flag count is equal to the bomb count.  If the flags match the bombs the clock and game will stop.


<h3><u>Notes:</u></h3>
<ol>
<li>This is a secondary design and does not list all of the variables that will be used.  </li>
<li>There will also be other objects added or removed at a later time </li>
<li>There will be more functions added later </li>
<li>This does not explain any of the graphical or visual layouts </li>
</ol>
